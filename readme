 <!-- W06 Project BYU Jun 2025 WDD330 -->
Overview 
This project proposes the development of a dynamic web application that serves as my online 
professional portfolio and personal brand hub. The primary problem it solves is providing a 
comprehensive, interactive, and up-to-date digital resume and portfolio for potential 
employers, collaborators, and anyone interested in my professional profile as a Systems Analyst 
(QA) with expertise in test automation, quality assurance, software development, and 
cybersecurity. My motivation to work on this project stems from the desire to consolidate my 
professional identity online, showcase my technical skills through practical application, and 
demonstrate my ability to integrate external data sources into a modern web experience. This 
application will go beyond a static resume by offering dynamic content and interactive features 
that highlight my capabilities in a tangible way. 
Target Audience 
The primary target audience for this application includes: 
• Hiring Managers and Recruiters: Individuals seeking QA Automation Engineers, 
Software Developers, or Cybersecurity professionals. 
• Potential Collaborators: Other professionals or teams looking for expertise in test 
automation, software development, or cybersecurity for joint projects. 
• Students and Aspiring Professionals: Individuals interested in learning about career 
paths in QA, development, or cybersecurity, who might find my projects and blog 
insights valuable. 
• Anyone interested in my professional profile: General visitors seeking information 
about my background, skills, and professional values. 
Major Functions 
The application will feature the following major functions: 
1. Professional Experience and Skills Display: A dedicated section will meticulously 
present my work experience, roles, responsibilities, and key achievements. It will 
highlight my expertise in technologies such as Java, Python, Selenium, Cucumber, SQL, 
HTML, CSS, and other relevant tools/frameworks through clear, concise descriptions 
and possibly visual indicators of proficiency. 
2. Key Projects Showcase: A comprehensive portfolio section will detail my contributions 
to various projects, with a particular focus on those related to test automation and 
cybersecurity. Each project will include a title, brief description, my specific role, 
technologies used, and a link to a live demo or repository (if applicable). 
3. Contact Information and Form: A dedicated "Contact" page will provide clear channels 
for potential employers or collaborators to reach me. This will include my professional 
email address, LinkedIn profile link, and a functional contact form that allows users to 
send messages directly from the website. 
4. Integrated Blog/Newsletter Feed: The application will feature a section that links to 
my "Technology on my Vision" newsletter/blog. This section will dynamically fetch and 
display recent blog post titles and snippets, demonstrating my thought leadership and 
continuous learning. 
5. Professional Values Statement: An "About Me" section will communicate my 
commitment to core professional values such as obedience, integrity, confidentiality, 
and diligence in my work, offering insight into my professional philosophy. 
6. Interactive Geolocation-Based Information: A dedicated page will utilize a third-party 
API to fetch and display information relevant to the user's current location (e.g., local 
news headlines, nearby points of interest, or cultural events). This will demonstrate 
dynamic content loading based on user context. 
7. Currency Exchange Rate Converter: Another dedicated page will integrate a second 
external API to provide real-time currency exchange rates. Users will be able to select 
two currencies and see the current conversion rate, showcasing API integration for 
practical utility. 
8. Responsive Navigation System: The application will feature a fully responsive 
navigation menu that adapts gracefully to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, 
mobile), ensuring easy access to all sections of the portfolio. This will include a 
hamburger menu for mobile views. 
9. Loading Indicators and Error Handling: For all dynamic content loaded via APIs, the 
application will display clear loading indicators (e.g., spinners) and implement robust 
error handling to provide user-friendly messages if an API is down, data cannot be 
fetched, or a location is not found. 
10.  CSS Animations for Enhanced UX: Subtle CSS animations will be incorporated 
throughout the site to enhance the user experience, such as smooth transitions for 
navigation, hover effects on project cards, and subtle animations for content loading or 
section reveals.
